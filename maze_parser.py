#some sort of way of keeping track of where we visited, probably just change actual maze
#a way to save the actual path we end up taking in order to save it

#maze is going to be a 2d char array
#useful functions, getNeighbors to get a set of coords back on status of neighbors
#			printMaze(show a pic of maze currently)
#			Manhattan distance		

#transitions, are just moving 1 either up down left or right, count # of steps
# for part 2 at least, we need to remove visited targets
# keep a set of what we've vistited
