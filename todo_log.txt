As of 1:30pm on Monday 9/25:
	filter out visited squares from getTransitions function
		--possibly done, but untested
	confirm that visited logic makes sense
	create backtrace for bfs
		--done but not test
	test bfs with backtrace
	constructing, testing, & debugging for dfs, greedy, and a* algorithms
	Fully accounting for multiple targets aka, all of 1.2

As of 6:42 on Wednesday 9/27:
	Finished: filtering visited sqaures
	BFS turned out to be a dfs algo, so bfs now super unfinished
	dfs works on medium, open, and small mazes, but recurses too deep on bigMaze
		--cannot get the path to return for some reason
		--honestly the most frustrating thing
			--FIXED 
	still need, bfs, greedy, and a*
	still need to account for multiple targets
